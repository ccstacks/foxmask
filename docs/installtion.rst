Installation
============

We provide two ways of installing and using FoxMask:

* Installation via a virtual machine (Any platform)
* Standalone installation on Linux

Installation via a virtual machine
==================================

We provide a complete virtual environment to run and
use FoxMask. The main advantages of this installation
is that there is no installation or configuration
needed, apart of course the needed virtual environment.
Also, this virtual environment can easily be deployed
on any virtual infrastructure (local cloud, Amazon or
Goodle cloud engine).

To run the virtual machine on your computer and to use
FoxMask, you will need the following three open source
softwares:

* `VirtualBox`_
* `Vagrant`_
* `Git`_

.. _vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/
.. _git: https://git-scm.com/

Follow the installation procedure for your platform.
Once theses softwares are installed, you are ready
to use FoxMask by issuing the following command:


.. code-block: console
